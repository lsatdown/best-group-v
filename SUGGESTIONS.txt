Transition/animation/UX suggestions

- It's a very elegant website, so I think subtlety is in order here...

- A soft animation on the text when the page loads might be quite good
on this kind of site?

- Read more button could maybe expand to the side a little bit, or something
subtle like that

- Navigation: perhaps something like hovering on one, gently fades out
the others?

- Mobile navigation: I went for a simple overlay, but I think something
a bit more modern might work: say a full screen slide in

- Mobile navigation icon: Decided to fix it to the top right, not sure
if that's what was intended, but I feel like it's easier to use that
way

- Tiles: I've done a colour change transition, but maybe instead we
could do something where the text moves up a notch and a small "view more"
or arrow icon comes in - or something along those lines
